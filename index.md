## Concert Companion

Concert Companion is an Android app that allows you to find, and track tour dates for your favorite musical artist. The app leverages data from several freely available APIs (Last.FM, BandsInTown, MusicBrainz, and Setlist.FM) to make sure you're aware of all upcoming tour dates. With the addition of the Setlist.FM API, you can also see what songs the band has been playing on their current tour.
